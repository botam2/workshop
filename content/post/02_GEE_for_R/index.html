# **Introduction**

Google Erth Engine is a cloud-based platform that allows both expert and non-expert users to access and run a large 
and non-expert users to access and run a large, planetary-scale remote sensing dataset in a matter of minutes. 
data in a matter of minutes.

Currently Google Earth Engine has JavaScript and Python as its official client libraries; however 
rgee is a new alternative that allows this same Google potential to be integrated within R.

# **Advantajes of use Google Earth Engine on R**

 - The syntax is shorter and understandable for users with little programming experience.
 - It allows the integration of the R spatial ecosystem.  
 - Application development is easier and more accessible thanks to the integration of flexdashboard and shiny.
 - Easy sharing of reproducible code.
 - API more friendly and intuitive to R users. 

# **Installation**

There is a space in the menu bar, where is the installation of rgee step by step in the different operating systems, in this section we will show the installation in an Ubuntu Operating System.

First you need to have your operating system configured with some space libraries installations, this is shown in the following Bash commands.  

```
# install system dependencies:
sudo apt install libudunits2-dev libgdal-dev libgeos-dev libproj-dev libfontconfig1-dev libjq-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

```
Once our system is configured, we proceed to install rgee inside R.

```
# binary versions of key R packages:
sudo apt install r-cran-rgee r-cran-geojsonio
```

- *geojsonio is necesarry to have install for working with some functions of rgee like <mark>sf_as_ee</mark>.*
---

rgee depends on some Python libraries like numpy and the earth engine api.
All this is automatically installed using the following function

```r{eval = FALSE}
rgee::ee_install()
```
It is necessary to restart the R session to verify the installation.

```r{eval = FALSE}
library(rgee)
ee_check()
```
```
◉  Python version
✓ [Ok] /home/ambarja/.virtualenvs/rgee/bin/python v3.8
◉  Python packages:
✓ [Ok] numpy
✓ [Ok] earthengine-api

```

# **Authentication**
When working with Google Earth Engine it is necessary to register our credentials only if they are needed to move data from Google Drive and Google Cloud Storage to our local environment. These dependencies are not mandatory, but are available within rgee.

rgee allows to work with the three google API'S, these are:
 - Google Earth Engine
 - Google Drive
 - Google Cloud Storage

To authenticate/initialize either Google Drive or Google Cloud Storage, you just need to run:

```r{eval = F}
library(rgee)
#ee_reattach() # reattach ee as a reserve word
# Initialize just Earth Engine
ee_Initialize() 
ee_Initialize(user = 'user_name@gmail.com') # Use the argument email is not mandatory, but it's helpful to change of EE user.
# Initialize Earth Engine and GD
ee_Initialize(user = 'user_name@gmail.com', drive = TRUE)
# Initialize Earth Engine and GCS
ee_Initialize(user = 'user_name@gmail.com', gcs = TRUE)
# Initialize Earth Engine, GD and GCS
ee_Initialize(user = 'user_name@gmail.com', drive = TRUE, gcs = TRUE)
```
If the Google account is verified and the permission is granted, you will be directed to an authentication token. Copy this token and paste it in your R console. Unlike Earth Engine and Google Drive, Google Cloud Storage needs to set up its credential manually ([link1](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleCloudStorageR/articles/googleCloudStorageR.html) and [link2](https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee/tree/help/gcs/)). In all cases, the user’s credentials will be stored in:

```r{eval=F}
ee_get_earthengine_path()
```
Remember you only have to authorize once, for subsequent sessions it will not be necessary.

title: who am I?
---

I act as squad coordinator at \@Banestes_SA, where I've been working since 2008. I'm an economist by trainning (Federal University of ES - UFES) and data scientist by affinity. Currently, I have been working with computational statistics and machine learning, focused on increasing the quality of information and reducing the uncertainty on decision making through statistical methods and experimentation.

I'm doing a second bachelor's degree, now in mathematics, at the Federal Institute of ES — Vitória. My research fields are time series econometrics, causal inference, mathematical economics, feature engineering and dataviz.

I'm a fan of basketball, football and motorsport. When I’m not in front of the computer writing code or studying, I’ll probably be crying in the comments section of some Senna video.
